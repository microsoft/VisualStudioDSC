# Visual Studio Desired State Configuration (DSC) Resource Provider

DSC resources to simplify state management of installed Visual Studio instances.

## VSComponents Resource

The `VSComponents` resource is used to modify a pre-existing Visual Studio instance in order to add additional [components](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/workload-and-component-ids). It is meant to accompany the [`winget configure`](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/configure) command. 

You currently need administrator permissions to use this resource to install or modify Visual Studio. Furthermore, Visual Studio must be closed in order to update or add components to it. 

Refer to [Use winget to install or modify Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/use-command-line-parameters-to-install-visual-studio?#use-winget-to-install-or-modify-visual-studio) for additional information.
